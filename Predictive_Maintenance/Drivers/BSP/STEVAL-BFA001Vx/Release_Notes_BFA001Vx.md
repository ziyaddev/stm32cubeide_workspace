# Purpose

The BSP (Board Support Package) STEVAL-BFA001Vx Board Drivers are based on the HAL drivers and provide a set of high level APIs relative to the hardware components
and features in the evaluation board for a given STM32 processor.

The BSP drivers allow a quick access to the boards’ services using high level APIs and without any specific configuration as the link with the HAL and the external
components is done in intrinsic within the drivers.

The figure below shows the overall architecture:
