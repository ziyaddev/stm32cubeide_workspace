@par Example Description 

This application shows how to implement a BLE Central device using an STM32 based board 
and a BlueNRG-2 module for Bluetooth Low Energy.

------------------------------------
WARNING: When starting the project from Example Selector in STM32CubeMX and regenerating 
it from ioc file, you may face a build issue. To solve it, remove from the IDE project 
the file stm32l4xx_nucleo.c in Application/User virtual folder and delete from Src and 
Inc folders the files: stm32l4xx_nucleo.c, stm32l4xx_nucleo.h and stm32l4xx_nucleo_errno.h.
------------------------------------

The BLE Central device is able to scan the BLE network, to connect to a BLE 
device (the peripheral), to discover its services and characteristics and to update
the characteristic properties enabling the data notifications, the reading and the 
writing.

The user can communicate with the BLE central device through a serial console, setting 
the Speed to 115200 baud/sec, where both the command menu and the peripheral information 
are printed.

@par Keywords

BLE, Central, Master, SPI
  
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32 Nucleo devices with BlueNRG-2 STM32 expansion board
    (X-NUCLEO-BNRG2A1)
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics:
    - NUCLEO-L476RG RevC board

  
@par How to use it? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
   installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
   after building.
 - Open STM32CubeIDE (this firmware has been successfully tested with Version 1.5.1).
   Alternatively you can use the Keil uVision toolchain (this firmware
   has been successfully tested with V5.31.0) or the IAR toolchain (this firmware has 
   been successfully tested with Embedded Workbench V8.50.5).
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the example.
 - Alternatively, you can download the pre-built binaries in "Binary" 
   folder included in the distributed package.
